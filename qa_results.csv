Course Title: COMPSCI 589  Machine Learning  
Question: What is the policy for late submissions or missed assessments? Are there any exceptions, and how can students request them?  
Answer: Late submissions have strict deadlines; any submission one minute late receives zero credit. Students have a total of seven free late days for homework, with penalties increasing based on how late the submission is. After using these days, late homework will not count for credit unless in special circumstances (e.g., documented illness). All exams must be taken as scheduled unless there is a documented conflict arranged in advance or a medical emergency with proof. Missing an exam without these justifications results in an "F" for that exam.

Question: What is the policy for late submissions or missed assessments? Are there any exceptions, and how can students request them?  
Answer: Late homework will be accepted up to 24 hours after the deadline with a 20% penalty unless waived or if it is the best of the late homework assignments. Students with Disability Services accommodations may submit late work with no penalty. Work submitted after the late day generally will not be accepted, but valid excuses can result in "excused" grades on specific assignments.

Question: What is the policy for late submissions or missed assessments? Are there any exceptions, and how can students request them?  
Answer: Students have three late days for homework assignments. After those are used, no more non-excused late submissions are accepted. Extensions for health, personal, and religious circumstances do not use late days, but must be arranged in advance (at least 24 hours). Job interviews and other schoolwork are not acceptable excuses for lateness. In unforeseen emergencies, students should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Makeup exams are available for absences due to valid reasons as per University policy, with prior written notice required for known conflicts.
