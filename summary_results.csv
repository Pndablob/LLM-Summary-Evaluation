Summarize the grading scale of this course in 1 paragraph,CS589,"Summary of COMPSCI 589 - Machine Learning: 
The grading scale for COMPSCI 589 consists of three main components: Homework Assignments (55%), Midterm Exam (30%), and a Project (15%). All homework assignments, which will be both written and programming tasks, will have equal weight. Grades will be assigned based on a cumulative score where 90%-100% equates to an A-/A, 75%-90% to a B-/B/B+, 65%-75% to a C-/C/C+, and 55%-65% to a D/D+. The grading scale will only be curved in favor of the students, allowing for lowered thresholds but no student scoring 90% or higher will receive less than an A-. Additionally, opportunities for extra credit may arise, and instructors retain the discretion to adjust grades penalizing inappropriate behavior such as academic dishonesty."

In CICS 210, the grading scale is structured to include various components that contribute to the final grade. Specifically, 5% of the grade is from in-person lab exercises, 20% from programming assignments, 15% from quizzes, and both midterm exams contribute 15% each, while the final exam accounts for 30% of the total grade. The course employs a standard numerical cutoff for letter grades, requiring at least a 93 for an A, 90 for an A-, and continuing with descending cutoffs for lower grades. Importantly, there will be no unannounced extra credit opportunities, and late submissions beyond a certain threshold will incur penalties. Students are expected to submit their work punctually via Gradescope, ensuring all guidelines are followed to maintain academic integrity."

Participation in discussion sections is mandatory, as is quiz completion linked to textbook material. A unique scoring system will translate raw scores from assignments and exams into normalized scores on a scale suitable for final grade calculations, allowing for better representation of students' overall performance."
Summarize the grading scale of this course in 1 paragraph,CS445,"Summary of COMPSCI 445 - Information Systems:  
The grading for COMPSCI 445 is based on several components with specific weightings: homework assignments constitute 55% of the total grade, quizzes account for 5%, and both the midterm and final exams are weighted at 20% each. The final score will be calculated on a [0-100] scale, which will be translated into letter grades without rounding. The grading scale is as follows: A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), and F (0-59).

The grading scale for COMPSCI 485 consists of various components leading to the final grade. Exercises account for 10%, with a simplified check/check-minus grading system, and the lowest exercise score will be dropped. Homework assignments contribute 30%, consisting of both written and programming tasks across four assignments. The midterm exam also constitutes 30% of the final grade. The final project, which includes a proposal, progress report, presentation, and final report, represents the remaining 30%, with each component weighted differently. The final letter grades will be determined using a defined scale, where an F is below 64%, and an A requires 93% or higher, allowing for potential adjustments based on curving or rescaling as deemed necessary."
